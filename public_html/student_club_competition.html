        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>The NeuroTechX Student Club Competition (SCC) is the first international undergraduate competition aimed toward neurotechnology and biosignal student clubs. The event brings together teams from all over the world to compete in designing and developing
          practical brain-computer interfaces, a type of communication system that uses direct inputs from the brain.</p>

        <p>At the intersection of neuroscience, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, the competition provides students with the opportunity to gain outstanding experience in the interdisciplinary field of neurotechnology,
          while also getting a shot at shaping its future.</p>

        <p>NeuroTechX is working closely with universities around the world to create student clubs dedicated to neurotechnology. Undergraduate students from any program or discipline can start a student club and join the competition. Students interested
          in starting a club need to be officially registered in an undergraduate program at a local university, and of course share a passion for brains and technology. For more information on how to start a student club in your local university, please
          contact us.</p>

  <!-- Why Section -->
  <section id="why" class="container content-section text-center">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
        <h2>Why</h2>

        <p>We believe neurotechnology is key to better understanding and to improving who we are.
        We aim to inspire a whole new generation of “neuroengineers”, who will be equipped to drive the field forward.</p>

        <p>With the rise of affordable brain-sensing technology and the ever-increasing availability of data and computing power,
        neurotechnology has never been this accessible before. We want to catalyze the interest and involvement of skilled undergraduate students in
        neurotechnology by providing them with a precise goal to work towards and the resources to get there.</p>

        <p>As a whole, the NeuroTechX Student Club Competition promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students of different backgrounds.
          Furthermore, it prepares the participants for careers and excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through self-learning,
          knowledge sharing, and practical experimentation.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <p>The NeuroTechX SCC has two major, independent components. First, the online competition has participants submit a video and description of an
        innovative take on brain-computer interfacing. Second, the onsite competition gathers participants from all over the world to display their solution
        to a common core brain-computer interfacing (BCI) challenge.</p>

        <h3>Remote/Online competition #1 - Winter 2016</h3>
        <h4>NeuroTechX SCC - Mind Challenge</h4>

        <p>The Mind Challenge, the first NeuroTechX Student Club Competition, calls for students to try their hand at BCI. Participants
        are invited to submit a video and complete technical description of an innovative solution to the current problems faced by the
        field. Submissions can target improvement of classical BCI strategies, new applications, use of new technologies such as virtual
        reality in a BCI context, or can alternatively be first steps towards participation in the upcoming onsite competition.
        Solutions will be evaluated according to their novelty, usefulness, and functionality. The best entry will win bonus points for
        their participation in the following onsite competition.</p>

        <p>More details to come.</p>


        <h3>Onsite competition #1 - Summer 2016</h3>
        <h4>NeuroTechX SCC - Practical BCI Challenge</h4>

        <p>The goal of the Practical BCI Challenge onsite competition is to design and develop an end-to-end BCI solution.
        The first edition will focus on a textbook example of a BCI application: the mind-controlled wheelchair.
        Teams are encouraged to come up with their own implementation and/or solution for as many parts of a BCI-controlled wheelchair
        as possible, including: 1) hardware (brain-sensing headset and other physical components), 2) software (signal processing
        and machine learning pipelines, user interface), and 3) BCI paradigm. Solutions will be evaluated according to their novelty,
        measured performance, stability and user-friendliness (see preliminary evaluation matrix in Appendix).

        <p>More details to come.</p>


        <p>The NeuroTechX SCC Mind Challenge and Practical BCI Challenge are meant to be recurring events, allowing student clubs
        to iterate on their solution from year to year. Additional sub-categories, such as affect recognition, use of peripheral
        signals, etc. will be added each year to promote innovation and will allow teams to win bonus points. Following events will
        be planned for Winter and Summer 2017. More details on venues and dates to be announced soon.</p>
